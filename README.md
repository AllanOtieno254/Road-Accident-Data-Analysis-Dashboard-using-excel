# Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains the **Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard**, an Excel-based tool designed to analyze and visualize road accident data. The dashboard offers insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), monthly trends, road types, and road surface conditions, aiding in data-driven decision-making for road safety management.

## Features
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Quick overview of total casualties, accident severity, and frequency.
- **Monthly Trends:** Visualize accident data over time to identify patterns and seasonal spikes.
- **Road Type Analysis:** Break down accident data by different road types (e.g., highways, urban roads).
- **Road Surface Conditions:** Analyze the impact of different surface conditions on accident rates.
- **Interactive Elements:** Slicers and filters for deep diving into specific data subsets.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Clear layout, color-coded sections, and accessibility considerations.
